# auto_correct_tool

-> The auto-correct tool is a user-friendly Python GUI application using tkinter and TextBlob. 
-> It corrects spelling errors in user-entered text by analyzing each word and suggesting corrections. 
-> The corrected version is displayed in a separate section, enabling quick editing and saving time when handling large texts.
-> Users can also clear the input/output text. 
-> Caution is advised, as auto-correction may not always be accurate; manual review of corrections is essential for critical contexts.
